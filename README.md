## Secret Santa
It's an opportunity to find a random person from the same price category to exchange gifts or create your group of friends to generate random pairs.

There are two different logic for generating pairs: 
 - for individual gift exchange when you submit the form you will get an information about your pair and this person will have you as his pair;

 - for group exchange at first you need to add all group members and then when you submit the group you will get a list of pairs where the giver can't be the reciver in the same pair.
